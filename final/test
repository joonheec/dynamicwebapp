October's Very Own and Canada Goose 
OVO x Canada Goose
Special Edition Chilliwack Bombers

October’s Very Own is once again teaming up with Canada Goose on a special edition range for 2016 fall/winter. The latest partnership tackles the heritage Chilliwack Bomber silhouette in two distinct colorways: jacquard black and desert khaki with safety orange accents in the liners. In addition, both tactical pieces cull the Canadian imprint’s iconic goose-down fill alongside elevated, shearling inner hoods. The bombers are complemented with co-branded truck caps predominantly wrapped in Cordura fabric
